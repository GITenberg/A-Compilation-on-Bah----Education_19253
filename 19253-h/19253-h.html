influence pervadeth all things and sustaineth them. It is for this
reason that God hath assumed the title, “Lord of all worlds”.
The other is confined to them that have come under the shadow of this
Name, and sought the shelter of this most mighty Revelation. They,
however, that have failed to seek this shelter, have deprived
themselves of this privilege, and are powerless to benefit from the
spiritual sustenance that hath been sent down through the heavenly

even stronger than before, and to shine in glory on the minds and
souls of men.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attainment of the most great guidance is dependent
upon knowledge and wisdom, and on being informed as to the mysteries
of the Holy Words. Wherefore must the loved ones of God, be they

eloquent advocates of the Lord God, disciples who are indeed pure and
spiritual descendants of him who was so close to the Holy Threshold.

perpetuate his teaching work, and when He learned of it, this

scope of their knowledge, the better and more gratifying will be the
result. Let the loved ones of God, whether young or old, whether male
or female, each according to his capabilities, bestir themselves and
spare no efforts to acquire the various current branches of
knowledge, both spiritual and secular, and of the arts. Whensoever
they gather in their meetings let their conversation be confined to
learned subjects and to information on the knowledge of the day.</p>

knowledge. If, then, the pursuit of knowledge leadeth to the beauty
of Him Who is the object of all knowledge, how excellent that goal;
but if not, a mere drop will perhaps shut a man off from flooding
grace, for with learning cometh arrogance and pride, and it bringeth
on error and indifference to God.</p>

they lead not to reality, naught remains but fruitless illusion. By

in this sphere from which the wise and their wisdom are shut out,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man is said to be the greatest representative of God,
and he is the Book of Creation because all the mysteries of beings
exist in him. If he comes under the shadow of the True Educator and
is rightly trained, he becomes the essence of essences, the light of
lights, the spirit of spirits; he becomes the centre of the divine
appearances, the source of spiritual qualities, the rising-place of
heavenly lights, and the receptacle of divine inspirations. If he is
deprived of this education, he becomes the manifestation of satanic
qualities, the sum of animal vices, and the source of all dark
conditions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reason of the mission of the Prophets is to educate
men, so that this piece of coal may become a diamond, and this
fruitless tree may be engrafted and yield the sweetest, most
delicious fruits. When man reaches the noblest state in the world of
humanity, then he can make further progress in the conditions of
perfection, but not in state; for such states are limited, but the
divine perfections are endless.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Close investigation will show that the primary cause of
oppression and injustice, of unrighteousness, irregularity and
disorder, is the people’s lack of religious faith and the fact
that they are uneducated. When, for example, the people are genuinely
religious and are literate and well-schooled, and a difficulty
presents itself, they can apply to the local authorities; if they do
not meet with justice and secure their rights and if they see that
the conduct of the local government is incompatible with the Divine
good pleasure and the king’s justice, they can then take their
case to higher courts and describe the deviation of the local
administration from the spiritual law. Those courts can then send for
the local records of the case and in this way justice will be done.
At present, however, because of their inadequate schooling, most of
the population lack even that vocabulary to explain what they want.</p>

kinds: material, human, and spiritual....”</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But education is of three kinds: material, human, and
spiritual. Material education is concerned with the progress and
development of the body, through gaining its sustenance, its material
comfort and ease. This education is common to animals and man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Human education signifies civilization and progress—that
is to say, government, administration, charitable works, trades, arts
and handicrafts, sciences, great inventions and discoveries and
elaborate institutions, which are the activities essential to man as
distinguished from the animal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Divine education is that of the Kingdom of God: it
consists in acquiring divine perfections, and this is true education;
for in this state man becomes the focus of divine blessings, the
manifestation of the words, “Let Us make man in Our image, and
after Our likeness.”<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
This is the goal of the world of humanity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now we need an educator who will be at the same time a
material, human, and spiritual educator, and whose authority will be
effective in all conditions. So if anyone should say, “I
possess perfect comprehension and intelligence, and I have no need of
such an educator”, he would be denying that which is clear and
evident, as though a child should say, “I have no need of
education; I will act according to my reason and intelligence, and so
I shall attain the perfections of existence”; or as though the
blind should say, “I am in no need of sight, because many other
blind people exist without difficulty.”</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then it is plain and evident that man needs an educator,
and this educator must be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in
all respects and distinguished above all men. Otherwise, if he should
be like the rest of humanity, he could not be their educator, more
particularly because he must be at the same time their material and
human as well as their spiritual educator—that is to say, he
must teach men to organize and carry out physical matters, and to
form a social order in order to establish cooperation and mutual aid
in living so that material affairs may be organized and regulated for
any circumstances that may occur. In the same way he must establish
human education—that is to say, he must educate intelligence
and thought in such a way that they may attain complete development,
so that knowledge and science may increase, and the reality of
things, the mysteries of beings, and the properties of existence may
be discovered; that, day by day, instructions, inventions, and
institutions may be improved; and from things perceptible to the
senses conclusions as to intellectual things may be deduced.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He must also impart spiritual education, so that
intelligence and comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world,
and may receive benefit from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy
Spirit, and may enter into relationship with the Supreme Concourse.
He must so educate the human reality that it may become the center of
the divine appearance, to such a degree that the attributes and the
names of God shall be resplendent in the mirror of the reality of
man, and the holy verse, “We will make man in Our image and
likeness”, shall be realized.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are some who imagine that an innate sense of human
dignity will prevent man from committing evil actions and insure his
spiritual and material perfection. That is, that an individual who is
characterized with natural intelligence, high resolve, and a driving
zeal, will, without any consideration for the severe punishments
consequent on evil acts, or for the great rewards of righteousness,
instinctively refrain from inflicting harm on his fellow men and will
hunger and thirst to do good. And yet, if we ponder the lessons of
history it will become evident that this very sense of honor and
dignity is itself one of the bounties deriving from the instructions
of the Prophets of God. We also observe in infants the signs of
aggression and lawlessness, and that if a child is deprived of a
teacher’s instructions his undesirable qualities increase from
one moment to the next. It is therefore clear that the emergence of
this natural sense of human dignity and honor is the result of
education. Secondly, even if we grant for the sake of the argument
that instinctive intelligence and an innate moral quality would
prevent wrongdoing, it is obvious that individuals so characterized
are as rare as the philosopher’s stone. An assumption of this
sort cannot be validated by mere words, it must be supported by the
facts. Let us see what power in creation impels the masses toward
righteous aims and deeds!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aside from this, if that rare individual who does
exemplify such a faculty should also become an embodiment of the fear
of God, it is certain that his strivings toward righteousness would
be strongly reinforced.</p>

among human beings and the superiority or...”</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the differences among human beings and the
superiority or inferiority of some individuals to others, the
materialists are of two schools of thought: one group is of the
opinion that these differences and the superior qualities of some
individuals are inborn, and are, as they would put it, an exigency of
nature. According to them, it is obvious that differences within the
species are inherent. For example, there are, in nature, different
kinds of trees; animals, too, are varied in their nature; even
minerals vary naturally among themselves, and you have here a quarry
filled with stones, there a mine of rubies, translucent and richly
red; here a shell with pearl enclosed, there only a bit a clay.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other school of traditional philosophers holdeth to
the view that the differences among individuals and the varying
levels of intellects and talents derive from education: for with
training, a crooked branch can grow straight, and a barren tree of
the desert can be domesticated, it can be grafted and made to bear
fruit, which may be bitter, but with time turneth sweet. At first,
its fruit may be small; but it will grow large and full of flavour, a
delight to the taste.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strongest proof adduced by the second group is this,
that the tribes of Africa are, generally speaking, ignorant and wild,
while the civilized peoples of America are, in general, possessed of
wisdom and understanding, which proveth that the difference between
these two peoples is due to education and experience. Such are the
stated views of the philosophers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Manifestations of God, on the other hand, affirm
that differences are demonstrably and indisputably innate, and that
“We have caused some of you to excel others”<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
is a proven and inescapable fact. It is certain that human beings
are, by their very nature, different one from the other. Observe a
small group of children, born of the same parents, attending the same
school, receiving the same education, living on the same diet: some,
becoming well educated, will achieve a high degree of advancement;
some will reach a middle level; and some will not prove educable at
all. It is therefore clear that the disparity among individuals is
due to differences of degree which are innate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Manifestations also consider that training and
education demonstrably exert a tremendous influence. If, for example,
a child is deprived of schooling he will certainly remain ignorant,
and his knowledge will be limited to what he is able to find out for
himself; but if he is brought to a qualified teacher to study the
sciences and arts, he will learn of the discoveries made by thousands
of other human beings. Thus education is a guide to those who have
gone astray; it maketh the blind to see; it bestoweth judgement on
the foolish, and a yield of greatness on the unproductive; it causeth
the mute to speak, and turneth the false dawn into the true morning’s
light; through it the tiny seed will become a towering palm, and the
runaway slave, a reigning king.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus is it certain that education exerteh an influence,
and for this reason the Manifestation of God, the Well-Springs of His
mercy, are raised up in the world, that through the breaths of
holiness They may educate the human race, and make of the sucking
child a strong and valiant man. Through Them will the outcasts of the
earth become the cherished companions of Heaven, and the portionless
receive their due.</p>

kinds of character has man, and what is the cause...”</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Question.—How many kinds of character has man, and
what is the cause of the differences and varieties in men?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Answer.—He has the innate character, the inherited
character, and the acquired character which is gained by education.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the innate character, although the divine
creation is purely good, yet the varieties of natural qualities in
man come from the difference of degree; all are excellent, but they
are more or less so, according to the degree. So all mankind possess
intelligence and capacities, but the intelligence, the capacity, and
the worthiness of men differ. This is evident.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For example, take a number of children of one family, of
one place, of one school, instructed by one teacher, reared on the
same food, in the same climate, with the same clothing, and studying
the same lessons—it is certain that among these children some
will be clever in the sciences, some will be of average ability, and
some dull. Hence it is clear that in the original nature there exists
a difference of degree and varieties of worthiness and capacity. This
difference does not imply good or evil but is simply a difference of
degree. One has the highest degree, another the medium degree, and
another the lowest degree. So man exists; the animal, the plant and
the mineral exist also—but the degrees of these four existences
vary. What a difference between the existence of man and of the
animal! Yet both are existences. It is evident that in existence
there are differences of degrees.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The variety of inherited qualities comes from strength
and weakness of constitution—that is to say, when the two
parents are weak, the children will be weak; if they are strong, the
children will be robust. In the same way, purity of blood has a great
effect; for the pure germ is like the superior stock which exists in
plants and animals. For example, you see that children born from a
weak and feeble father and mother will naturally have a feeble
constitution and weak nerves; they will be afflicted and will have
neither patience, nor endurance, nor resolution, nor perseverance,
and will be hasty; for the children inherit the weakness and debility
of their parents.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides this, an especial blessing is conferred on some
families and some generations. Thus it is an especial blessing that
from among the descendants of Abraham should have come all the
Prophets of the children of Israel. This is a blessing that God has
granted to this descent: to Moses from his father and mother, to
Christ from his mother’s line; also to Muḥammad and the
the Báb, and to all the Prophets and the Holy Manifestations
of Israel. The Blessed Beauty<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
is also a lineal descendant of Abraham, for Abraham had other sons
besides Ishmael and Isaac who in those days migrated to the lands of
Persia and Afghanistan, and the Blessed Beauty is one of their
descendants.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence it is evident that inherited character also
exists, and to such a degree that if the characters are not in
conformity with their origin, although they belong physically to that
lineage, spiritually they are not considered members of the family,
like Canaan,<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a>
who is not reckoned as being of the race of Noah.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the difference of the qualities with regard to
culture is very great, for education has great influence. Through
education the ignorant become learned; the cowardly become valiant.
Through cultivation the crooked branch becomes straight; the acid,
bitter fruit of the mountains and woods becomes sweet and delicious;
and the five-petaled flower becomes hundred-petaled. Through
education savage nations become civilized, and even the animals
become domesticated. Education must be considered as most important,
for as diseases in the world of bodies are extremely contagious, so,
in the same way, qualities of spirit and heart are extremely
contagious. Education has a universal influence, and the differences
caused by it are very great.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps someone will say that, since the capacity and
worthiness of men differ, therefore, the difference of capacity
certainly causes the difference of characters.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this is not so, for capacity is of two kinds:
natural capacity and acquired capacity. The first, which is the
creation of God, is purely good—in the creation of God there is
no evil; but the acquired capacity has become the cause of the
appearance of evil. For example, God has created all men in such a
manner and has given them such a constitution and such capacities
that they are benefited by sugar and honey and harmed and destroyed
by poison. This nature and constitution is innate, and God has given
it equally to all mankind. But man begins little by little to
accustom himself to poison by taking a small quantity each day, and
gradually increasing it, until he reaches such a point that he cannot
live without a gram of opium every day. The natural capacities are
thus completely perverted. Observe how much the natural capacity and
constitution can be changed, until by different habits and training
they become entirely perverted. One does not criticize vicious people
because of their innate capacities and nature, but rather for their
acquired capacities and nature.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In creation there is no evil; all is good. Certain
qualities and natures innate in some men and apparently blameworthy
are not so in reality. For example, from the beginning of his life
you can see in a nursing child the signs of greed, of anger and of
temper. Then, it may be said, good and evil are innate in the reality
of man, and this is contrary to the pure goodness of nature and
creation. The answer to this is that greed, which is to ask for
something more, is a praiseworthy quality provided that it is used
suitably. So if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge, or
to become compassionate, generous, and just, it is most praiseworthy.
If he exercises his anger and wrath against the bloodthirsty tyrants
who are like ferocious beasts, it is very praiseworthy; but if he
does not use these qualities in a right way, they are blameworthy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the difference between that material civilization
now prevailing, and the divine civilization which will be one of the
benefits to derive from the House of Justice, it is this: material
civilization, through the power of punitive and retaliatory laws,
restraineth the people from criminal acts; and notwithstanding this,
while laws to retaliate against and punish a man are continually
proliferating, as ye can see, no laws exist to reward him. In all the
cities of Europe and America, vast buildings have been erected to
serve as jails for the criminals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Divine civilization, however, so traineth every member
of society that no one, with the exception of a negligible few, will
undertake to commit a crime. There is thus a great difference between
the prevention of crime through measures that are violent and
retaliatory, and so training the people, and enlightening them, and
spiritualizing them, that without any fear of punishment or vengeance
to come, they will shun all criminal acts. They will, indeed, look
upon the very commission of a crime as a great disgrace and in itself
the harshest of punishments. They will become enamoured of human
perfections, and will consecrate their lives to whatever will bring
light to the world and will further those qualities which are
acceptable at the Holy Threshold of God.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">See then how wide is the difference between material
civilization and divine. With force and punishments, material
civilization seeketh to restrain the people from mischief, from
inflicting harm on society and committing crimes. But in a divine
civilization, the individual is so conditioned that with no fear of
punishment, he shunneth the perpetration of crimes, seeth the crime
itself as the severest of torments, and with alacrity and joy,
setteth himself to acquiring the virtues of humankind, to furthering
human progress, and to spreading light across the world.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the safeguards of the Holy Faith is the training
of children, and this is among the weightiest of principles in all
the Divine Teachings. Thus from the very beginning mothers must rear
their infants in the cradle of good morals—for it is the
mothers who are the first educators—so that, when the child
cometh to maturity, he will prove to be endowed with all the virtues
and qualities that are worthy of praise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And further, according to the Divine commandments, every
child must learn reading and writing, and acquire such branches of
knowledge as are useful and necessary, as well as learning an art or
skill. The utmost care must be devoted to these matters; any neglect
of them, any failure to act on them, is not permissible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Observe how many penal institutions, houses of detention
and places of torture are made ready to receive the sons of men, the
purpose being to prevent them, by punitive measures, from committing
terrible crimes—whereas this very torment and punishment only
increaseth depravity, and by such means the desired aim cannot be
properly achieved.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore must the individual be trained from his
infancy in such a way that he will never undertake to commit a crime,
will, rather, direct all his energies to the acquisition of
excellence, and will look upon the very commission of an evil deed as
in itself the harshest of all punishments, considering the sinful act
itself to be far more grievous than any prison sentence. For it is
possible so to train the individual that, although crime may not be
completely done away with, still it will become very rare.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The purport is this, that to train the character of
humankind is one of the weightiest commandments of God, and the
influence of such training is the same as that which the sun exerteth
over tree and fruit. Children must be most carefully watched over,
protected and trained; in such consisteth true parenthood and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The root cause of wrongdoing is ignorance, and we must
therefore hold fast to the tools of perception and knowledge. Good
character must be taught. Light must be spread afar, so that, in the
school of humanity, all may acquire the heavenly characteristics of
the spirit, and see for themselves beyond any doubt that there is no
fiercer Hell, no more fiery abyss, than to possess a character that
is evil and unsound; no more darksome pit nor loathsome torment than
to show forth qualities which deserve to be condemned.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The individual must be educated to such a high degree
that he would rather have his throat cut than tell a lie, and would
think it easier to be slashed with a sword or pierced with a spear
than to utter calumny or be carried away by wrath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus will be kindled the sense of human dignity and
pride, to burn away the reapings of lustful appetites. Then will each
one of God’s beloved shine out as a bright moon with qualities
of the spirit, and the relationship of each to the Sacred Threshold
of his Lord will be not illusory but sound and real, will be as the
very foundation of the building, not some embellishment on its
façade.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It followeth that the children’s school must be a
place of utmost discipline and order, that instruction must be
thorough, and provision must be made for the rectification and
refinement of character; so that, in his earliest years, within the
very essence of the child, the divine foundation will be laid and the
structure of holiness raised up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Know that this matter of instruction, of character
rectification and refinement, of heartening and encouraging the
child, is of the utmost importance, for such are basic principles of
God.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, if God will, out of these spiritual schools
illumined children will arise, adorned with all the fairest virtues
of humankind, and will shed their light not only across Persia, but
around the world.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is extremely difficult to teach the individual and
refine his character once puberty is passed. By then, as experience
has shown, even if every effort be exerted to modify some tendency of
his, it all availeth nothing. He may, perhaps, improve somewhat
today; but let a few days pass and he forgetteth, and turneth
backward to his habitual condition and accustomed ways. Therefore it
is in early childhood that a firm foundation must be laid. While the
branch is green and tender it can easily be made straight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our meaning is that qualities of the spirit are the
basic and divine foundation, and adorn the true essence of man; and
knowledge is the cause of human progress. The beloved of God must
attach great importance to this matter, and carry it forward with
enthusiasm and zeal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The education and training of children is among the most
meritorious acts of humankind and draweth down the grace and favour
of the All-Merciful, for education is the indispensable foundation of
all human excellence and alloweth man to work his way to the heights
of abiding glory. If a child be trained from his infancy, he will,
through the loving care of the Holy Gardener, drink in the crystal
waters of the spirit and of knowledge, like a young tree amid the
rilling brooks. And certainly he will gather to himself the bright
rays of the Sun of Truth, and through its light and heat will grow
ever fresh and fair in the garden of life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore must the mentor be a doctor as well: that is,
he must, in instructing the child, remedy its faults; must give him
learning, and at the same time rear him to have a spiritual nature.
Let the teacher be a doctor to the character of the child, thus will
he heal the spiritual ailments of the children of men.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, in this momentous task, a mighty effort be exerted,
the world of humanity will shine out with other adornings, and shed
the fairest light. Then will this darksome place grow luminous, and
this abode of earth turn into Heaven. The very demons will change to
angels then, and wolves to shepherds of the flock, and the wild-dog
pack to gazelles that pasture on the plains of oneness, and ravening
beasts to peaceful herds; and birds of prey, with talons sharp as
knives, to songsters warbling their sweet native notes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the inner reality of man is a demarcation line
between the shadow and the light, a place where the two seas meet;<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>
is the lowest point on the arc of descent,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
therefore is it capable of gaining all the grades above. With
education it can achieve all excellence; devoid of education it will
stay on, at the lowest point of imperfection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every child is potentially the light of the world—and
at the same time its triple darkness; wherefore must the question of
education be accounted as of primary importance. From his infancy,
the child must be nursed at the breast of God’s love, and
nurtured in the embrace of His knowledge, that he may radiate light,
grow in spirituality, be filled with wisdom and learning, and take on
the characteristics of the angelic host.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since ye have been assigned to this holy task, ye must
therefore exert every effort to make that school famed in all
respects throughout the world; to make it the cause of exalting the
Word of the Lord.</p>

the day, and become an ensign of God’s abounding grace; that
these children, reared one and all in the holy Teachings, will

Utilize every means to make this School a garden of the All-Merciful,
from which the lights of learning will cast their beams, and wherein
the children, whether Bahá’í or other, will be
educated to such a degree as to become God’s gifts to man, and
the pride of the human race. Let them make the greatest progress in
the shortest span of time, let them open wide their eyes and uncover
the inner realities of all things, become proficient in every art and
skill, and learn to comprehend the secrets of all things even as they
are—this faculty being one of the clearly evident effects of
servitude to the Holy Threshold.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is certain that ye will make every effort to bring
this about, will also draw up plans for the opening of a number of
schools. These schools for academic studies must at the same time be
training centres in behaviour and conduct, and they must favour
character and conduct above the sciences and arts. Good behaviour and
high moral character must come first, for unless the character be
trained, acquiring knowledge will only prove injurious. Knowledge is
praiseworthy when it is coupled with ethical conduct and virtuous
character; otherwise it is a deadly poison, a frightful danger. A
physician of evil character, and who betrayeth his trust, can bring
on death, and become the source of numerous infirmities and diseases.

This is a service rendered unto God Himself, and it is one of His

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherefore, O loving friends, strive with heart and soul
and strength to make the Tarbíyat School a center of

may shine with the rays of boundless learning, and that these tender
plants of the divine garden may grow and flourish in the grace that

education of children. Those children who,...”</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thou didst ask as to the education of children. Those
children who, sheltered by the Blessed Tree, have set foot upon the
world, those who are cradled in the Faith and are nurtured at the
breast of grace—such must from the beginning receive spiritual
training directly from their mothers. That is, the mother must
continually call God to mind and make mention of Him, and tell of His
greatness, and instill the fear of Him in the child, and rear the
child gently, in the way of tenderness, and in extreme cleanliness.
Thus from the very beginning of life every child will be refreshed by
the gentle wafting of the love of God and will tremble with joy at
the sweet scent of heavenly guidance. In this lieth the beginning of
the process; it is the essential basis of all the rest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And when the child hath reached the age where he can
make distinctions, let him be placed in a Bahá’í
school, in which at the beginning the Holy Texts are recited and
religious concepts are taught. At this school the child is to study
reading and writing as well as some fundamentals of the various
branches of knowledge, such as can be learned by children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the start the teacher must place a pen in the child’s
hand, arrange the children in groups, and instruct each group
according to its capacity. When the children have, in a given place,
been seated in rows, and each holdeth a pen, and each hath a paper
before him, and the teacher hath suspended a blackboard in front of
the children, let him write thereon with his chalk and have the
children copy what he hath written. For example, let the teacher
write an alif ( a ) and say, “This is an alif.” Let the
children then copy it and repeat: “This is an alif.” And
so on, till the end of the alphabet. As soon as they properly
recognize the letters, let the teacher make combinations of the
letters, while the children follow his lead, writing the combinations
on their paper, until, by this method, they come to recognize all the
letters, singly and combined in words. Let the teacher then proceed
to writing sentences, while the children copy what he hath written,
each on his own sheet of paper. Let the teacher then explain the
meaning of the sentence to the children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And once they have become skilled in the Persian tongue,
let the teacher first translate and write out single words and ask
the students the meaning of those words. If a pupil hath grasped a
little of this, and hath translated the word, let the teacher praise
him; if all the students are unable to accomplish this, let the
teacher write the foreign language translation beneath the given
word. For example, let him write samá (heaven) in Arabic, and
ask: “How do we say this in Persian?” If one of the
children replieth, “The Persian translation of this word is
asiman”, let the teacher praise and encourage him. If they are
unable to answer, let the teacher himself give the translation and
write it down, and let the children copy it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Later, let the teacher ask: “How do they say this
in Russian, or French, or Turkish?” If they know the answer,
excellent. If not, let the teacher say, “In Russian, or French,
the translation is thus and so”, write the word on the board,
and have the children copy it down. When the children have become
skilled in translating single words, let the teacher combine the
words into a sentence, write this on the board and ask the children
to translate it. If they are unable, let the teacher himself
translate the sentence and write down the translation. It would of
course be preferable for him to make use of several languages.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this way, over a short period—that is, three
years—the children will, as a result of writing the words down,
become fully proficient in a number of languages, and will be able to
translate a passage from one language to another. Once they have
become skilled in these fundamentals, let them go on to learning the
elements of the other branches of knowledge, and once they have
completed this study, let each one who is able and hath a keen desire
for it, enrol in higher institutions of learning and study advanced
courses in the sciences and arts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not all, however, will be able to engage in these
advanced studies. Therefore, such children must be sent to industrial
schools where they can also acquire technical skills, and once the
child becomes proficient in such a skill, then let consideration be
given to the child’s own preference and inclinations. If a
child hath a liking for commerce, then let him choose commerce; if
industry, then industry; if for higher education, then the
advancement of knowledge; if for some other of the responsibilities
of humankind, then that. Let him be placed in the field for which he
hath an inclination, a desire, and a talent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the indispensable basis of all is that he should
develop spiritual characteristics and the praiseworthy virtues of
humankind. This is the primary consideration. If a person be
unlettered, and yet clothed with divine excellence, and alive in the
breaths of the Spirit, that individual will contribute to the welfare
of society, and his inability to read and write will do him no harm.
And if a person be versed in the arts and every branch of knowledge,
and not live a religious life, and not take on the characteristics of
God, and not be directed by a pure intent, and be engrossed in the
life of the flesh—then he is harm personified, and nothing will
come of all his learning and intellectual accomplishments but scandal
and torment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, however, an individual hath spiritual
characteristics, and virtues that shine out, and his purpose in life
be spiritual and his inclinations be directed toward God, and he also
study other branches of knowledge—then we have light upon
light:<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>

many, and for lack of time We can touch on only a few: First and most
important is training in behaviour and good character; the

accomplished and acquire perfections, and to cleave unto the religion
of God and stand firm in His Laws: to accord total obedience to every
just government, to show forth loyalty and trustworthiness to the
ruler of the time, to be well wishers of mankind, to be kind to all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And further, as well as in the ideals of character,
instruction in such arts and sciences as are of benefit, and in
foreign tongues. Also, the repeating of prayers for the well-being of
ruler and ruled; and the avoidance of materialistic works that are
current among those who see only natural causation, and tales of
love, and books that arouse the passions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To sum up, let all the lessons be entirely devoted to
the acquisition of human perfections.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, then, in brief are directions for the curriculum
of these schools.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the organization of the schools: If possible the
children should all wear the same kind of clothing, even if the
fabric is varied. It is preferable that the fabric as well should be
uniform; if, however, this is not possible, there is no harm done.
The more cleanly the pupils are, the better; they should be
immaculate. The school must be located in a place where the air is
delicate and pure. The children must be carefully trained to be most
courteous and well-behaved. They must be constantly encouraged and
made eager to gain all the summits of human accomplishment, so that
from their earliest years they will be taught to have high aims, to
conduct themselves well, to be chaste, pure, and undefiled, and will
learn to be of powerful resolve and firm of purpose in all things.
Let them not jest and trifle, but earnestly advance unto their goals,
so that in every situation they will be found resolute and firm.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Training in morals and good conduct is far more
important than book learning. A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of
good character, well-behaved—even though he be ignorant—is
preferable to a child that is rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet
becoming deeply versed in all the sciences and arts. The reason for
this is that the child who conducts himself well, even though he be
ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill-natured, ill-behaved
child is corrupted and harmful to others, even though he be learned.
If, however, the child be trained to be both learned and good, the
result is light upon light.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Children are even as a branch that is fresh and green;
they will grow up in whatever way you train them. Take the utmost
care to give them high ideals and goals, so that once they come of
age, they will cast their beams like brilliant candles on the world,
and will not be defiled by lusts and passions in the way of animals,
heedless and unaware, but instead will set their hearts on achieving
everlasting honour and acquiring all the excellences of humankind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this holy Cause the question of orphans hath the
utmost importance. The greatest consideration must be shown towards
orphans; they must be taught, trained and educated. The Teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh, especially, must by all means
be given to them as far as is possible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I supplicate God that thou mayest become a kind parent
to orphaned children, quickening them with the fragrances of the Holy

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter hath come and hath occasioned the utmost
joy, with its news that, praised be God, in Hamadán a welfare
and relief association hath been established. I trust that this will
become a source of general prosperity and assistance, and that means
will be provided to set the hearts of the poor and weak at rest, and
to educate the orphans and other children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question of training the children and looking after
the orphans is extremely important, but most important of all is the
education of girl children, for these girls will one day be mothers,
and the mother is the first teacher of the child. In whatever way she
reareth the child, so will the child become, and the results of that
first training will remain with the individual throughout his entire
life, and it would be most difficult to alter them. And how can a
mother, herself ignorant and untrained, educate her child? It is
therefore clear that the education of girls is of far greater
consequence than that of boys. This fact is extremely important, and
the matter must be seen to with the greatest energy and dedication.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">God sayeth in the Qur’án that they shall
not be equals, those who have knowledge and those who have it not.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
Ignorance is thus utterly to be blamed, whether in male or female;
indeed, in the female its harm is greater. I hope, therefore, that
the friends will make strenuous efforts to educate their children,
sons and daughters alike. This is verily the truth, and outside the
truth there is manifestly naught save perdition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thou didst write about the believers’ daughters
who attend the schools of other faiths. It is true that, while these
children do learn a little in such schools, still the character and
behaviour of the women teachers have an effect on them, and through
the inculcation of doubts and ambiguities, the minds of these girls
are influenced and changed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is incumbent upon the friends to provide a school for
Bahá’í girls whose women teachers will educate
their pupils according to the teachings of God. There must the girls
be taught spiritual ethics and holy ways.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A child is as a young plant: it will grow in whatever
way you train it. If you rear it to be truthful, and kind, and
righteous, it will grow straight, it will be fresh and tender, and
will flourish. But if not, then from faulty training it will grow
bent, and stand awry, and there will be no hope of changing it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Certainly, the women teachers from Europe give
instruction in language and scripts, and housekeeping, and embroidery
and sewing; but their pupils’ character is completely altered,
to such a point that the girls no longer care for their mothers,
their disposition is spoiled, they misbehave, they become
self-satisfied and proud.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rather, girls ought to be trained in such a manner that
from day to day they will become more self-effacing, more humble, and
will defer to and obey their parents and forebears, and be a comfort
and a solace to all.</p>

watch over their little daughters and have them thoroughly taught in

and will provide a family with comfort and joy.</p>

within their children faith and certitude, the fear of God, the love
of the Beloved of the worlds, and all good qualities and traits.
Whensoever a mother seeth that her child hath done well, let her
praise and applaud him and cheer his heart; and if the slightest
undesirable trait should manifest itself, let her counsel the child
and punish him, and use means based on reason, even a slight verbal
chastisement should this be necessary. It is not, however,
permissible to strike a child, or vilify him, for the child’s
character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or
verbal abuse.</p>

If so helpless a creature can be endowed with so subtle a capacity,
how much more efficacious must be the power released through the
liberal effusions of the grace of Bahá’u’lláh!
What confirmations will be garnered, what influxes of the heart!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherefore, O ye illumined youth, strive by night and by
day to unravel the mysteries of the mind and spirit, and to grasp the
secrets of the Day of God. Inform yourselves of the evidences that
the Most Great Name hath dawned. Open your lips in praise. Adduce
convincing arguments and proofs. Lead those who thirst to the
fountain of life; grant ye true health to the ailing. Be ye
apprentices of God; be ye physicians directed by God, and heal ye the
sick among humankind. Bring those who have been excluded into the
circle of intimate friends. Make the despairing to be filled with
hope. Waken them that slumber; make the heedless mindful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such are the fruits of this earthly life. Such is the
station of resplendent glory.</p>

matter of educating the boys and girls. One of the duties devolving
upon the members of Spiritual Assemblies is that, with the support of

for the instruction of boys and girls in the things of the spirit,
the fundamentals of teaching the Faith, reading the Sacred Writings,
learning the history of the Faith, the secular branches of knowledge,
the various arts and skills, and the different languages—so
that Bahá’í methods of instruction will become so

all the children of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá whether in the

Effendi’s hope is that they will, the three of them, become
able and devoted speakers on the Cause and subjects akin to it. To do
this properly they will need a firm foundation of scientific and
literary training which fortunately they are obtaining. It is just as
important for the Bahá’í young boys and girls to
become properly educated in colleges of high standing as it is to be
spiritually developed. The mental as well as the spiritual side of
the youth has to be developed before he can serve the Cause
efficiently. From Shoghi Effendi’s postscript:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">... I will specially pray for your dear children, that
they, too, firmly-grounded through a well-guided plan of sound
education, may in days to come serve efficiently and effectively the

that a proper training may enable them to utilize those gifts for the

learning and the promulgation of Bahá’í rules of

awakened out of its sleep of negligence, and the Government has begun
to consider the promotion and expansion of its educational
establishment, let the Bahá’í representatives in
that country arise in such a manner that as a result of their high
endeavours in every hamlet, village and town, of every province and
district, preliminary measures will be taken for the setting up of
institutions for the study of sciences, the liberal arts and
religion. Let Bahá’í children without any
exceptions learn the fundamentals of reading and writing and

conduct, the Bahá’í way of life—become so

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Master used to attach much importance to the
learning by heart of Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh
and the Báb. During His days it was a usual work of the
children of the household to learn Tablets by heart; now, however,
those children are grown up and do not have time for such a thing.
But the practice is most useful to implant the ideas and spirit those
words contain into the mind of the children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With “The Dawn-Breakers” in your possession
you could also arrange interesting stories about the early days of
the Movement which the children would like to hear. There are also
stories about the life of Christ, Muḥammad and the other
prophets which if told to the children will break down any religious
prejudice they may have learned from older people of little
understanding.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such stories regarding the life of different prophets
together with their sayings will also be useful to better understand
the literature of the Cause for there is constant reference to them.
It is however the work of experienced people to bring together such
materials and make of them interesting text books for the children.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Cause will gradually produce people who would answer
these needs. It is only a question of time. What we should strive to
do is to stimulate different individuals who have the talent to

Love and kindness have far greater influence than punishment upon the
improvement of human character.</p>

no such thing as a Bahá’í curriculum, and there
are no Bahá’í publications exclusively devoted to
this subject, since the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá do not present a definite and
detailed educational system, but simply offer certain basic
principles and set forth a number of teaching ideals that should
guide future Bahá’í educationalists in their
efforts to formulate an adequate teaching curriculum which would be
in full harmony with the spirit of the Bahá’í
Teachings, and would thus meet the requirements and needs of the
modern age.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These basic principles are available in the sacred
writings of the Cause, and should be carefully studied, and gradually
incorporated in various college and university programmes. But the
task of formulating a system of education which would be officially
recognized by the Cause, and enforced as such throughout the Bahá’í
world is one which [the] present-day generation of believers cannot
obviously undertake, and which has to be gradually accomplished by
Bahá’í scholars and educationalists of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the statement attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and which you have quoted in your letter regarding a “problem
child”: these statements of the Master, however true in their
substance, should never be given a literal interpretation.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá could have never meant that a child
should be left to himself, entirely free. In fact Bahá’í
education, just like any other system of education, is based on the
assumption that there are certain natural deficiencies in every
child, no matter how gifted, which his educators, whether his
parents, schoolmasters, or his spiritual guides and preceptors,
should endeavour to remedy. Discipline of some sort, whether
physical, moral or intellectual, is indeed indispensable, and no
training can be said to be complete and fruitful if it disregards
this element. The child when born is far from being perfect. It is
not only helpless, but actually is imperfect, and even is naturally
inclined towards evil. He should be trained, his natural inclinations
harmonized, adjusted and controlled, and if necessary suppressed or
regulated, so as to ensure his healthy physical and moral
development. Bahá’í parents cannot simply adopt
an attitude of non-resistance towards their children, particularly
those who are unruly and violent by nature. It is not even sufficient
that they should pray on their behalf. Rather they should endeavour
to inculcate, gently and patiently, into their youthful minds such
principles of moral conduct and initiate them into the principles and
teachings of the Cause with such tactful and loving care as would
enable them to become “true sons of God” and develop into
loyal and intelligent citizens of His Kingdom. This is the high
purpose which Bahá’u’lláh Himself has
clearly defined as the chief goal of every education.</p>

child, as emphasized time and again in Bahá’í

privilege is indeed to create in her home such conditions as would be
most conducive to both his material and spiritual welfare and
advancement. The training which a child first receives through his
mother constitutes the strongest foundation for his future
development, and it should therefore be the paramount concern of your
wife...to endeavour from now imparting to her new-born son such
spiritual training as would enable him later on to fully assume and
adequately discharge all the responsibilities and duties of Bahá’í
life.</p>

up in a thoroughly religious atmosphere, you should also be careful

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You ask him about the fear of God: perhaps the friends
do not realize that the majority of human beings need the element of
fear in order to discipline their conduct? Only a relatively very
highly evolved soul would always be disciplined by love alone. Fear
of punishment, fear of the anger of God if we do evil, are needed to
keep people’s feet on the right path. Of course we should love
God—but we must fear Him in the sense of a child fearing the
righteous anger and chastisement of a parent; not cringe before Him
as before a tyrant, but know His mercy exceeds His justice!</p>

sometimes have complicated personalities and need very wise handling
to enable them to grow into normal, moral, happy adults. If you feel

Flanagan’s school you could send him there. But in general we
should certainly always avoid sending Bahá’í

become good, and produce better fruit. These children must be given a
good training from their earliest childhood. They must be given a
systematic training which will further their development from day to
day, in order that they may receive greater insight, so that their
spiritual receptivity be broadened. Beginning in childhood they must
receive instruction. They cannot be taught through books. Many
elementary sciences must be made clear to them in the nursery; they
must learn them in play, in amusement. Most ideas must be taught them
through speech, not by book learning. One child must question the
other concerning these things, and the other child must give the
answer. In this way, they will make great progress. For example,
mathematical problems must also be taught in the form of questions
and answers. One of the children asks a question and the other must
give the answer. Later on, the children will of their own accord
speak with each other concerning these same subjects. The children
who are at the head of the class must receive premiums. They must be
encouraged and when any one of them shows good advancement, for the
further development they must be praised and encouraged therein. Even
so in Godlike affairs. Oral questions must be asked and the answers
must be given orally. They must discuss with each other in this
manner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The art of music is divine and effective. It is the food
of the soul and spirit. Through the power and charm of music the
spirit of man is uplifted. It has wonderful sway and effect in the
hearts of children, for their hearts are pure and melodies have great
influence in them. The latent talents with which the hearts of these
children are endowed will find expression through the medium of
music. Therefore, you must exert yourselves to make them proficient;
teach them to sing with excellence and effect. It is incumbent upon
each child to know something of music, for without knowledge of this
art the melodies of instrument and voice cannot be rightly enjoyed.
Likewise, it is necessary that the schools teach it in order that the
souls and hearts of the pupils may become vivified and exhilarated
and their lives be brightened with enjoyment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Today illumined and spiritual children are gathered in
this meeting. They are the children of the Kingdom. The Kingdom of
heaven is for such souls as these, for they are near to God. They
have pure hearts. They have spiritual faces. The effect of the divine
teachings is manifest in the perfect purity of their hearts. That is
why Christ has addressed the world, saying, “Except ye be
converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven”—that is, men must become pure in heart
to know God. The teachings have had great effect. Spiritual souls!
Tender souls! The hearts of all children are of the utmost purity.
They are mirrors upon which no dust has fallen. But this purity is on
account of weakness and innocence, not on account of any strength and
testing, for as this is the early period of their childhood, their
hearts and minds are unsullied by the world. They cannot display any
great intelligence. They have neither hypocrisy nor deceit. This is
on account of the child’s weakness, whereas the man becomes
pure through his strength. Through the power of intelligence he
becomes simple; through the great power of reason and understanding
and not through the power of weakness he becomes sincere. When he
attains to the state of perfection, he will receive these qualities;
his heart becomes purified, his spirit enlightened, his soul is
sensitized and tender—all through his great strength. This is
the difference between the perfect man and the child. Both have the
underlying qualities of simplicity and sincerity—the child
through the power of weakness and the man through the power of
strength.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I give you my advice, and it is this: Train these
children with divine exhortations. From their childhood instill in
their hearts the love of God so they may manifest in their lives the
fear of God and have confidence in the bestowals of God. Teach them
to free themselves from human imperfections and to acquire the divine
perfections latent in the heart of man. The life of man is useful if
he attains the perfections of man. If he becomes the center of the
imperfections of the world of humanity, death is better than life,
and nonexistence better than existence. Therefore, make ye an effort
in order that these children may be rightly trained and educated and
that each of them may attain perfection in the world of humanity.
Know ye the value of these children for they are all my children.</p>

equality of men and women be realized, the foundations of war will be
utterly destroyed. Without equality this will be impossible because
all differences and distinction are conducive to discord and strife.
Equality between men and women is conducive to the abolition of
warfare for the reason that women will never be willing to sanction
it. Mothers will not give their sons as sacrifices upon the
battlefield after twenty years of anxiety and loving devotion in
rearing them from infancy, no matter what cause they are called upon
to defend. There is no doubt that when women obtain equality of
rights, war will entirely cease among mankind.</p>

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
